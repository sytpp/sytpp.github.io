 		I am Sylvia. I am a computational biologist by training, a scientist at heart. After digging through DNA of embryonic stem cells during my PhD, I took to science journalism, learned the wizardry of words and ended up with data again. Asking a question, designing the right experiment, acquiring data to give an answer and visualising it with a sensible graph - that's me.
