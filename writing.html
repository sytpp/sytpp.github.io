<p class="writing-intro">These are some bits and pieces I published between 2012 and 2014, before and while branching out into journalism. They illustrate the transition from rather specialised science communication in molecular biology to science and data journalism for a lay audience. There are interesting challenges on both ends of the spectrum: Being specific, concise, but not boring on one end and simple, yet factually correct on the other. Either way, I try to be interesting.</p>
